# countdown-timer

### TODO:
- [ ] Utilize local storage so that countdown can persist for users beyond a single session
- [ ] Ask user what the countdown is for, and generate a heading based on input
- [ ] Validate user input ( no dates from the past )
- [ ] Use a custom modal instead of window prompt for user input
- [ ] Create animation effect when countdown ends
