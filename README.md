# countdown-timer

A countdown timer to showcase the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the desired part of your timeline arrives.

Created for fun, and to begin experimenting with the Vue.js framework.

### TODO:

- [x] Utilize local storage so that countdown can persist for users beyond a single session
- [ ] Ask user what the countdown is for, and generate a heading based on input
- [ ] Validate user input ( no dates from the past )
- [ ] Use a custom modal instead of window prompt for user input
- [ ] Create animation effect when countdown ends
